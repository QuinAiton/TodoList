import React from "react";

const About = () => {

      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        This is my fist experience building with react. It is a simple todo list
        app that allows the user to add, delete and mark elements as completed
        while also being able to move the elements around the page.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default About;
